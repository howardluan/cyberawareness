# Cybersecurity Awareness Assessment
### About this project
There are a lot of cyber attacks that comes from social engineering, or phishing and scamming. I have been noticing that a lot of my friends and people around me got scammed, lost access to their bank account, so I create this project to raise awareness about phishing, scamming/fraud. There are a lot of sites online that quizzes you on these topics, but I do not feel that they are good enough. Hopefully this project will be better than the one that is currently on the internet. This project focus on the social engineering part of the cybersecurity, or the human side of cyber attack. I hope you will enjoy the assessment as much as I do. If you have any questions or feedback or suggestions, scroll to the bottom.
